# UP Platform Android SDK
## Overview and Requirements
The UP Platform Android SDK is released as a library to perform requests to UP Platform API from Android devices. It handles authentication using OAuth 2.0 via Android WebView and also provides interfaces to make network requests to the UP platform's REST endpoints.  
It is assumed that the SDK users are familiar with Java programming language and Google’s Android SDK. The SDK has been developed on a MacBook Pro running OS X Mavericks and Android Studio 0.8.4 and supports all Android versions from 4.0 onwards. It is also assumed that the user has access to an existing Jawbone UP user account in order to authenticate with the UP platform. New accounts can be created at [jawbone.com/start/signup](http://jawbone.com/start/signup). Note that the user will also need to register at [Jawbone UP Developer Portal](http://jawbone.com/up/developer) and create an app in order to get the **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** constant values needed for OAuth authentication.

## Getting Started

#### Obtain Your OAuth Credentials
Sign into the [Jawbone UP Developer Portal](http://jawbone.com/up/developer) using your Jawbone UP account. If you do not have an account you can create one by going to [jawbone.com/start/signup](http://jawbone.com/start/signup). Register your organization by pressing "Manage Account". Follow the instructions to create a new app and get your OAuth Client ID and App Secret keys that you will use to authenticate with the UP Platform.  
Specify your custom redirect URI in the "OAuth Redirect URI" field or use the default value **up-platform://redirect**. Note that for Android SDK this url is redundant, we will never leave the app and thus won't need to be redirected to it. But the OAuth specification calls for it. Also, this framework is also used by Jawbone for web based OAuth authentication so we leave it here. Suffice to say whatever non-null uri is entered here should be the same used in app.


#### Download the Jawbone UP Android SDK
You can download the latest Android SDK release via the link below or clone it directly from this GitHub repository:

**Option 1:** Download UP Android SDK Alpha (July 2014)  
`https://github.com/Jawbone/UPPlatform_Android_SDK/tag/v0.1-alpha`

**Option 2:** Clone this repository from GitHub  
`git clone git@github.com:Jawbone/UPPlatform_Android_SDK`

#### Project Setup and Usage Instructions
UpPlatformSdk is being distributed as an Android Library project, and thus can be imported in an existing project as a "Module" (we do this in Android Studio by **"File" -> "Import Module.."** in Android Studio menu). The current project structure as uploaded in Github (seen below) has the SDK already imported and the HelloUp app in Examples folder uses it. 

![Project Structure]
(Documentation/project_structure.png)

UpPlatformSdk is the main library module that provides OAuth authentication, API end points, data model and a Retrofit based network stack that handles the API calls. The HelloUp project in Examples folder is the test app and has UpPlatformSdk as its library dependency. It  provides **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** viz. the app specific credentials generated from Jawbone UP Developer Portal. Note that even though this project structure assumes Android Studio as the IDE used, but these instructions can be modified for use in Eclipse IDE too.

There are two ways to quickly get started with using the SDK:
* Clone this repo, open the project in Android Studio and then, either modify HelloUp app to suit your needs or just create another project for your app and start using the SDK.
* Clone this repo, and then in your own project import the SDK and start using it. Another thing to note is, because we are using the __OauthWebViewActivity__ from a library project, it needs to be added to the app's manifest file (in this case HelloUp's AndroidManifest.xml)

## Documentation
#### Authentication
The developer obtains the **CLIENT_ID** and **CLIENT_SECRET** from the Developer Portal, sets them up in his app as constants (in this case in HelloUp app).   
``` Java
private static final String CLIENT_ID = "<insert-client-id>";  
private static final String CLIENT_SECRET = "<insert-client-secret>";
```

We then define the permissions needed in our test app activity (__HelloUpActivity.getIntentForWebView()__ in this instance) and then pass them to __UpPlatformSdkUtils__ that generates the url for OAuth permisssions request Web View (as displayed by __OauthWebViewActivity__).
``` Java
    private Intent getIntentForWebView() {
        Uri.Builder builder = UpPlatformSdkUtils.setOauthParameters(CLIENT_ID, OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL, authScope);

        Intent intent = new Intent(OauthWebViewActivity.class.getName());
        intent.putExtra(UpPlatformSdkUtils.AUTH_URI, builder.build());
        return intent;
    }
```

We then call get the webview intent and launch the OAuth flow.  

The user will sign in with his username/password with his UP user credentials. When the user agrees with the permissions requested and hits okay button the response from server will contain a “code”. This is parsed out and another network call is made whose response will contain the accessToken and refreshToken, which __HelloUpActivity__ saves to shared preferences for easy access. Thus the app now has the accessToken needed to make api requests.

``` Java
    private Callback accessTokenRequestListener = new Callback<OauthAccessTokenResponse>() {
        @Override
        public void success(OauthAccessTokenResponse result, Response response) {

            if (result.access_token != null) {
                SharedPreferences preferences = PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(HelloUpActivity.this);
                SharedPreferences.Editor editor = preferences.edit();
                editor.putString(UpPlatformSdkConstants.UP_PLATFORM_ACCESS_TOKEN, result.access_token);
                editor.putString(UpPlatformSdkConstants.UP_PLATFORM_REFRESH_TOKEN, result.refresh_token);
                editor.commit();

                Intent intent = new Intent(HelloUpActivity.this, UpApiListActivity.class);
                intent.putExtra(UpPlatformSdkConstants.CLIENT_SECRET, CLIENT_SECRET);
                startActivity(intent);

                Log.e(TAG, "accessToken:" + result.access_token);
            } else {
                Log.e(TAG, "accessToken not returned by Oauth call, exiting...");
            }
        }

        @Override
        public void failure(RetrofitError retrofitError) {
            Log.e(TAG, "failed to get accessToken:" + retrofitError.getMessage());
        }
    };
```

#### API End Points
Now there are a few ways to create API requests. You can either use the Retrofit end points provided, or you can create own network stack. The Retrofit API end points provided are the simplest way to create requests to the UP platform. They take care of creating requests objects, handling responses parsed out from JSON. The UP Platform SDK provides an simple mechanism to make an API request, it is of the following form:

``` Java
    ApiManager.getRestApiInterface().getMealEvent(
        UpPlatformSdkConstants.API_VERSION_STRING,
        "JtN269m6S_xmX72fwD63cg", //hardcoded value, should be dynamic
        genericCallbackListener); //Retrofit callback handler
```

Currently all api endpoints are defined in __RestApiInterface__, the output of the calls being logged to console. The data model to absorb the JSON returned will be added later.

The following UP Platform End points are supported in this SDK:

## Additional Resources
You can find additional Jawbone UP Platform documentation [here](http://jawbone.com/start/signup)  
We use 2 different open source libraries in this SDK, they are:  
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - to provide basic networking capabilities for API requests. It is included in this repo as a jar file.  The version used also depends on OkHttp and okio hence are also added
* [Gson Parser](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/) – to handle incoming and outgoing JSON objects.
